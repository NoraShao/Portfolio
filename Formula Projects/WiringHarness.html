                The wiring harness in our race car consists of three main harnesses; the main trunk harness, engine harness, 
                and the sensor harness. <br>
                The main trunk and engine harness work together to provide power to and enable communication between 
                all the electrical modules on the car. The main trunk harness connects the main electrical modules at
                the front of the car, and connects to the engine harness at the back of the car via an engine bulkhead
                connector. Like its name suggests, the engine harness connects to the car engine and delivers signals to
                various modules at the back of the car, including for shifting and actuating the brake light. 
                The harnesses are essential for the operating of the car. <br>
                The sensor harness primarily aids data collection on various parts of the car while its running, which 
                other subteams use to improve their designs. The signals from the sensors (i.e. brake pressure, wheel speeds,
                shock position, etc.) all travel to our AIM EVO5 Datalogger, where we collect the data from, via a USB
                or wifi.

                In the 2023-2024 school year, I was responsible for remaking the main trunk and sensor harnesses. Because the 
                sensor harness is not essential for the car to run, we prioritized designing and manufacturing the main trunk
                harness.

              Harness Design
              </h3>
              <p>
                I started designing the main trunk and sensor harnesses by mapping out the necessary signals between all
                the modules in Google Sheets. The primary goal of doing this was to have an accessible and easily updatable
                record of what signals each wire from each connector socket carried. Most of the connectors and connections
                were of key electrical modules that didn't change from year to year, but I also had to figure out how to
                incorporate changes for the new year such as new electrical modules and different signals that subteams
                needed.  
              </p>
              <p>
                For organization and safety, we followed these guidelines for selecting wires: <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ul class="custom-list">
                    <li>
                      22 AWG wires for power wires not expected to carry excessive current and all signal wires
                      <ul class="custom-list">
                        <li>5V (sensor) power: red</li>
                        <li>General signals: blue</li>
                        <li>Sensor GND: purple</li>
                        <li>CAN HI, CAN LO (for CAN bus communication between modules): yellow, green</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      18 AWG wires for power lines expected to carry more current. The higher wire gauge is to minimize the
                      risk of overheating.

              <p>
                To main the robustness of both harnesses, we made sure they were protected against any environmental or 
                factors or risks related to being in an automotive. For example, they needed to safely operate
                on the car in any weather condition, and shouldn't be damaged by the movement of the car. To ensure this,
                we follow these specifications when manufacturing them:
              </p>
              <ul class="custom-list">
                <li>
                  Used Tefzel wires, which are used in many motorsport and industrical applications due to their chemical
                  resistance and high temperature tolerance.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created relief loops at the base of all wires protruding from connectors, and secured them with thermally 
                  stable and electrically insulating Kapton tape: this relieves stress from the crimp pins securing the wire
                  in the connector sockets when wires are pulled, and also offers leeway in terms of wire length if we need 
                  to cut and repin the other side of the wire. <br>

                  IP-65 rating or higher for all connectors: This ensures the junctions between the wires and electrical 
                  modules should be highly dust and water resistant, preventing faulty signal connections or dangerous water
                  shorts. We primarily use Deutsch DTM (for sensors and general purpose), AMPSeal, and on out-sourced modules,
                  OEM connectors, and cover the OEM connectors with heat shrink boots.<br>

                <li>
                  Enclosed all wire bundles and connectors with Raychem DR-25 heatshrink: DR-25 heatshrink is 
                  laceration-resistant, which protects the wires from being cut by factors such as excessive rubbing
                  against sharp edges (which occurs frequently due to the aggressive movement of the car). It also 
                  protects the wires from possible water shorts.

                <li>
                  Concentric-twisted all wire bundles: This serves two purposes. First, twisting wires increases their 
                  relative angles, minimizing electrical noise from the induced magnetic fields around each current-carrying
                  wire. Second, twisting wires makes them more resist to stress from bending, because instead of wires being
                  either fully compresses or stretched depending on their position in the bundle, twisted wires will be
                  compressed and stretched at different points.

              In addition to manufacturing the brake light PCB, I was also responsible for protecting
              it from environmental factors and mounting it on the car. I designed a 3D-printable resin enclosure in 
              Solidworks that could be mounted onto the rear differentials of the car and would also act as a diffuser 
              for the LEDs. Before I secured the PCB in its water and airtight enclosure, for additional water resistance, 
              I applied a layer of conformal coating onto the PCB itself.
